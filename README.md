# Blip-Blop-for-Android
Blip &amp;  Blop port android

Blip & Blop is a game released in 2002 by LOADED Studio on Windows, developped in C++ and DirectX.  
After playing this game for a long time in my early teenage years, I later had the opportunity to see the [modernized source code](https://github.com/benkaraban/blip-blop) of the game (already using a partial port SDL) and I decided to port it on Android, it took about a week.
The compiled portage is available here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfp6GL_Hqk

Update 2021 : 
This game is not available on Google play anymore, but a binary can be found on Amazon : https://www.amazon.fr/Smartties-Blip-Blop/dp/B00L1I5JPG/
